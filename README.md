This repository contains my [thesis](./thesis.pdf) and the scripts I used
to run the experiments evaluating DRAT proof checker [`rate`].

The full data set with the results is in [results.json](./results.json)
Based on that, `make` generates the thesis, as well as some [tables](./t),
[plots](./p) and fancy a [poster](./poster/poster.pdf).

The workflow to run the experiments is roughly `./deploy.sh` to copy to a
remote machine; then execute `./run-all.sh` there.
