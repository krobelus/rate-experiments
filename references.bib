abstract="We present an algorithm and tool to convert derivations from the powerful recently proposed PR proof system into the widely used DRAT proof system. The PR proof system allows short proofs without new variables for some hard problems, while the DRAT proof system is supported by top-tier SAT solvers. Moreover, there exist efficient, formally verified checkers of DRAT proofs. Thus our tool can be used to validate PR proofs using these verified checkers. Our simulation algorithm uses only one new Boolean variable and the size increase is at most quadratic in the size of the propositional formula and the PR proof. The approach is evaluated on short PR proofs of hard problems, including the well-known pigeon-hole and Tseitin formulas. Applying our tool to PR proofs of pigeon-hole formulas results in short DRAT proofs, linear in size with respect to the size of the input formula, which have been certified by a formally verified proof checker.",

abstract="Modern SAT solvers use preprocessing and inprocessing techniques that are not solely based on resolution; existing unsatisfiability proof formats do not support SAT solvers using such techniques. We present a new proof format for checking unsatisfiability proofs produced by SAT solvers that use techniques such as extended resolution and blocked clause addition. Our new format was designed with three goals: proofs should be easy to generate, proofs should be compact, and validating proofs must be simple. We show how existing preprocessors and solvers can be modified to generate proofs in our new format. Additionally, we implemented a mechanically-verified proof checker in ACL2 and a proof checker in C for the proposed format.",

SAT solvers are a powerful tool to test the hardness of certain problems and have successfully been used to test hardness assumptions. This paper extends a SAT solver to efficiently work on cryptographic problems. The paper further illustrates how SAT solvers process cryptographic functions using automatically generated visualizations, introduces techniques for simplifying the solving process by modifying cipher representations, and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach by solving three stream ciphers.",

title = "Conflict-driven clause learning SAT solvers",
abstract = "One of the most important paradigm shifts in the use of SAT solvers for solving industrial problems has been the introduction of clause learning. Clause learning entails adding a new clause for each conflict during backtrack search. This new clause prevents the same conflict from occurring again during the search process. Moreover, sophisticated techniques such as the identification of unique implication points in a graph of implications, allow creating clauses that more precisely identify the assignments responsible for conflicts. Learned clauses often have a large number of literals. As a result, another paradigm shift has been the development of new data structures, namely lazy data structures, which are particularly effective at handling large clauses. These data structures are called lazy due to being in general unable to provide the actual status of a clause. Efficiency concerns and the use of lazy data structures motivated the introduction of dynamic heuristics that do not require knowing the precise status of clauses. This chapter describes the ingredients of conflict-driven clause learning SAT solvers, namely conflict analysis, lazy data structures, search restarts, conflict-driven heuristics and clause deletion strategies.",
