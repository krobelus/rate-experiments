abstract="We present an algorithm and tool to convert derivations from the powerful recently proposed PR proof system into the widely used DRAT proof system. The PR proof system allows short proofs without new variables for some hard problems, while the DRAT proof system is supported by top-tier SAT solvers. Moreover, there exist efficient, formally verified checkers of DRAT proofs. Thus our tool can be used to validate PR proofs using these verified checkers. Our simulation algorithm uses only one new Boolean variable and the size increase is at most quadratic in the size of the propositional formula and the PR proof. The approach is evaluated on short PR proofs of hard problems, including the well-known pigeon-hole and Tseitin formulas. Applying our tool to PR proofs of pigeon-hole formulas results in short DRAT proofs, linear in size with respect to the size of the input formula, which have been certified by a formally verified proof checker.",

abstract="Modern SAT solvers use preprocessing and inprocessing techniques that are not solely based on resolution; existing unsatisfiability proof formats do not support SAT solvers using such techniques. We present a new proof format for checking unsatisfiability proofs produced by SAT solvers that use techniques such as extended resolution and blocked clause addition. Our new format was designed with three goals: proofs should be easy to generate, proofs should be compact, and validating proofs must be simple. We show how existing preprocessors and solvers can be modified to generate proofs in our new format. Additionally, we implemented a mechanically-verified proof checker in ACL2 and a proof checker in C for the proposed format.",
