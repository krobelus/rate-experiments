**Abstract:** Clausal proof format DRAT is the de facto standard way to
certify SAT solvers' unsatisfiability results.  DRAT proofs consist of lemmas
(clause introductions) and clause deletions.  State-of-the-art DRAT proof
checkers ignore deletions of unit clauses, which means that they are checking
against a proof system that differs from the specification of DRAT and they
may not be able to verify inprocessing techniques that use unit deletions.
State-of-the-art SAT solvers produce proofs that are accepted by those
DRAT checkers, but are incorrect under the DRAT specification, because
they contain spurious deletions of unit clauses. We present patches for
award-winning SAT solvers to produce proofs without those deletions that
are thus correct with respect to the specification.  However, handling
unit deletions is still desirable, as they can be a byproduct of advanced
inprocessing techniques in a solver that is hard to avoid without extra costs.
Performing unit deletions in a proof checker can be computationally expensive.
We implemented the first competitive checker that honors unit deletions and
provide experimental results suggesting that, on average, checking costs are
the same as when not applying unit deletions.  As it is also expensive to
determine the incorrectness of a proof, we introduce the SICK format which
describes small and efficiently checkable certificates of the incorrectness of
a DRAT proof. By checking this independently, we are able to increase trust
in our incorrectness results. Additionally it can be useful when debugging
solvers and checkers.

1 Introduction
==============

Over the past decades, there has been significant progress in SAT
solving technology. At the same time, SAT solvers have had documented bugs
\cite{BrummayerBiere-SMT09} \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/BrummayerLB10}.  To detect
incorrect results, there are *checker* programs that *verify* a solver's result
based on a witness given by the solver. Satisfiability witnesses, or *models*
can be checked in linear time.  Unsatisfiability witnesses, or *proofs*
of unsatisfiability on the other hand can be much more costly to check.

A SAT solver operates on a formula that acts as knowledge base.  It contains
constraints that are called clauses.  Starting from the input formula,
clauses are added and deleted during solving.  In SAT competitions, solvers
are required to give proofs of unsatisfiability in the DRAT proof format
\cite{DBLP:journals/stvr/HeuleHW14}. A DRAT proof is the trace of a solver
run, containing information on which clauses are added and deleted.

State-of-the-art proof checkers ignore deletions of some clauses called
*unit clauses* \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}.  As a result, the
checkers are not faithful to the specification of DRAT proofs.  The original
definition of the proof format is referred to as *specified* DRAT and the
one that is implemented by state-of-the-art checkers as *operational* DRAT
\cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}. The classes of proofs verified by
checkers of these two flavors of DRAT are incomparable.

Specified DRAT can be required to verify advanced inprocessing steps
performed by state-of-the-art solvers whose proofs contain unit clause
deletions \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}: since the correctness of
the *non-monotonic* inferences relies not only on the presence, but also the
absence of clauses, it is crucial that deletions are honored.  The proofs for
inprocessing techniques like XOR reasoning \cite{DBLP:conf/jelia/PhilippR16}
and symmetry breaking \cite{DBLP:conf/cade/HeuleHW15} are generated by
hard-coded routines; it would require additional reasoning to detect unit
deletions.  Additionally, when a solver reuses a variable that only exists
in clauses that have been deleted, an operational checker might give an
incorrect result due to these clauses.

Moving from operational DRAT to specified DRAT requires changes in some
state-of-the-art SAT solvers because their proofs can be incorrect under
specified DRAT.  To the best of our knowledge, all of those solvers are based
on `MiniSat` \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/EenS03}.  Their proofs can be incorrect
under specified DRAT because they may contain some deletions of unit clauses.
As we did not see a motivation for those deletions, we investigated how they
are being generated.  We found that the solvers who emit the problematic
deletions do not undo inferences made using the deleted clauses, hence acting
as if they had not been deleted.  Since operational DRAT ignores deletions
of unit clauses, state-of-the-art proof checkers interpreted it as if the
clauses were not deleted, matching the solvers' internal behavior.  Luckily,
fixes appear to be simple and non-intrusive: we provide small patches for
award-winning solvers to make them generate proofs without counter-productive
unit deletions, eliminating the need to ignore them.

DRAT proofs are designed to use minimal space per proof step but checking them
is computationally expensive.  In theory, checking costs are comparable to
solving costs \cite{DBLP:journals/stvr/HeuleHW14}. Consider the problem
of the Schur Number Five, where solving took just over 14 CPU years
whereas running the DRAT checker on the resulting proof took 20.5 CPU years
\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/Heule18}.  Clearly, it is essential for a proof checker
to be as efficient as possible to deal with such workloads. When considering
switching to specified DRAT, it is important to assess any additional costs.
A checker for specified DRAT may incur an overhead due to the need to honor
unit deletions.  There is an efficient algorithm to check specified DRAT
\cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/Rebola-PardoC18} that introduces several optimizations
that are not necessary for checking operational DRAT.  Previous results
suggest that the checking costs do not change significantly.  However, those
results were based on a checker that was not as efficient as state-of-the-art
operational DRAT checkers.  This motivates our central research question:

*Is it possible to check specified DRAT as efficiently as operational DRAT?*

To answer this, we implemented a checker for specified DRAT with
state-of-the-art performance.  Our experimental results suggest that specified
and operational DRAT are equally expensive to check on the average real-world
instance.  We also observe that a high number of unit deletions may have a
significant negative impact on checking performance for specified DRAT.

The majority of solvers at SAT competitions are derived from `MiniSat` and
produce proofs that are incorrect under specified DRAT. For those incorrect
proofs, our checker outputs a small, efficiently checkable incorrectness
certificate in the SICK format which was originally developed along with
the first checker for specified DRAT[^rupee] but has not been published.
The incorrectness certificate can be used to check the incorrectness of
a proof, independent of the checker, which helps developers in debugging
proof-generation and proof-checking algorithms.  While checking operational
DRAT efficiently is arguably easier than checking specified DRAT, the
straighforward semantics of specified DRAT facilitates reasoning about a
proof, e.g.\ it allows the definition of the SICK format to be much simpler.
We contribute an extension to the SICK format to support a slightly different
semantics of DRAT checking.

This thesis is organized as follows: In [the next section][2 Preliminaries]
we will introduce preliminary knowledge about SAT solving, proofs of
unsatisfiability and proof checking, including the optimization challenges of
specified DRAT checking.  In [Section 3][3 A Tiny Tweak to Proof Generation
in `MiniSat`-based SAT Solvers] we propose how to change `MiniSat`-based
solvers to produce unambiguously correct proofs.  [Section 4][4 A Complete
and Efficient DRAT Proof Checker] concerns the efficient implementation
of our specified DRAT checker:  after briefly discussing other checkers we
present our implementation and describe the SICK format for certificates of
proof incorrectness.  Experimental results evaluating checker performance
are given in [Section 5][5 Experimental Evaluation].  Finally, we draw a
conclusion in [Section 6][6 Conclusion] and give outlook on future work in
the area of DRAT proof-checking in [the last section][7 Future Work].

2 Preliminaries
===============

A *literal* is a propositional variable, like $x$, or the negation of
a variable, denoted by $\overline{x}$. A *clause* is a disjunction of
literals, usually denoted by juxtaposition of the disjuncts, e.g. we write
$xy\overline{z}$ for $x \lor y \lor \overline{z}$.

An *assignment* is a finite, complement-free set of literals. All literals
in an assignment are considered to be *satisfied* by that assignment.
Conversely, the complements of those literals are *falsified* by the
assignment.  Other literals are *unassigned*.

A clause is satisfied by an assignment $I$ if any literal in the clause
is satisfied by $I$.  SAT solvers work on formulas in *conjunctive normal
form* (CNF), conjunctions (or multisets) of clauses.A formula in CNF is
satisfied by $I$ if each of its clauses is satisfied by $I$. An assignment
that satisfies a formula is called a *model* for that formula. A formula
is *satisfiable* if there exists a model for it. Two formulas $F$ and $G$
are *satisfiability-equivalent* if $F$ is satisfiable if and only $G$
is satisfiable.

A *unit clause* with respect to some assignment contains only falsified
literals except for a single non-falsified *unit literal*.

\paragraph{Unit Propagation} Let $F$ be a CNF formula. We say that a literal
$l$ is implied by *unit propagation* over $F$ whenever there is a finite
*propagation sequence* of clauses $(C_1,\dots,C_n) \subseteq F$ such that for
each $1 \leq i \leq n$ there is a literal $l_i \in C_i$ with $C_i \setminus
\{l_i\} \subseteq \{\overline{l_1},\dots,\overline{l_{i-1}}\}$.  We call $C_i$
the *reason clause* for $l_i$ with respect to this propagation sequence.
Observe that every reason clause is a unit clause.

An assignment $I$ is a *unit propagation model* (UP-model) of $F$ when for each
clause $C \in F$, $I$ either satisfies $C$ or there are at least two literals
in $C$ that are unassigned in $I$ \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}.
Formula $F$ is *UP-satisfiable* if it has a UP-model. Otherwise --- if
complementary literals are implied by unit propagation, or the formula contains
the empty clause --- it is *UP-unsatisfiable*. If $F$ is UP-satisfiable, its
*shared UP-model* is the intersection of all UP-models. It is the assignment
consisting of all literals implied by unit propagation in $F$. It is a
subset of every model of $F$. Clause $C$ is called a *unique reason clause*
in formula $F$ if the shared UP-model of $F \setminus \{C\}$ is strictly
smaller than the shared UP-model of $F$.

2.1 SAT Solving
---------------

A SAT solver takes as input a formula and finds a model if the formula
is satisfiable. Otherwise, the solver provides a proof that the formula
is unsatisfiable.  While searching for a model, a solver maintains an
assignment that represents the shared UP-model of the formula, along
with the order in which the literals were assigned.  We call this data
structure the *trail*.  SAT solvers search through the space of all possible
assignments.  They make *assumptions*, temporarily adding size-one clauses
to the formula.  This triggers unit propagation, adding more literals to
the trail.  These literals are implied by unit propagation in the formula
plus the current assumptions.  Only assignments that are a superset of the
trail are considered during search, which means that many assignments are
pruned from the search space. Additionally, solvers may use inprocessing
techniques to modify the formula without changing satisfiability.  Once the
trail falsifies a clause, the (UP-)unsatisfiability of the formula plus
assumptions is established.  If there are assumptions, some of them are undone
(*backtracking* \cite{769433}) and the solver resumes search.  Otherwise,
if there are no assumptions, the input formula is unsatisfiable.

\paragraph{Efficient Implementation of Unit Propagation} To efficiently keep
track of which clauses can become unit, competitive solvers and checkers use
the two-watched-literal scheme \cite{DBLP:conf/dac/MoskewiczMZZM01}. For
each literal in the formula, it keeps a *watchlist* of clause references.
Clauses in the watchlist of some literal are said to be *watched on*
that literal.  Each non-deleted clause is watched on two literals,
which are also called its *watches*. Provided that Invariant 1 from
\cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/Rebola-PardoC18} is maintained, it suffices to look
at the watches to determine that a clause is not unit:

**Invariant 1.** If a clause is watched on two distinct literals $l$ and $k$,
and the current trail $I$ falsifies $l$, then $I$ satisfies $k$.

A clause that is not already satisfied can only become unit if one of its
watches is falsified. When literal $l$ is assigned, it is sufficient to
visit clauses in the watchlist of $\overline{l}$ to find new unit clauses ---
that is clauses that became unit due to assigning $l$. For visited clauses
that are not unit, the watches may need to be changed to restore Invariant 1.

As an example, we perform unit propagation on formula $F = \{x,
\overline{y}\overline{x}z, \overline{x}y, xy\}$.  Let the first two literals
in each clause be watched.  So only $\overline{y}$ and $x$ are watched in the
second clause. To change watches, we simply flip the order of the literals
in the clause. Initially, only the size-one clause $x$ is unit. Two clauses
are watched on $\overline{x}$, so they need to be inspected: Invariant 1
is violated in $\overline{y}\overline{x}z$, so the watches will be changed,
making the clause $\overline{y}z\overline{x}$. Additionally, $\overline{x}y$
is unit, which triggers propagation of $y$. Only $\overline{y}z\overline{x}$
is watched on $\overline{y}$, which triggers propagation of $z$, but no clause
is watched on $\overline{z}$, so propagation ends at this point. Clause $xy$
is never visited during propagation because it is not watched on any relevant
literal. The fact that unrelated clauses do not need to be visited is the
central advantage of the two-watched literal scheme.

\paragraph{CDCL} Predominant SAT solvers implement Conflict Driven Clause
Learning (CDCL) \cite{DBLP:series/faia/SilvaLM09} which is based on the
following principle: whenever the formula plus assumptions is UP-unsatisfiable,
a subset of the assumptions is undone and a *conflict clause* is learned
--- it is added to the formula to prevent the solver from revisiting those
wrong assumptions.  As the number of clauses increases, so does memory usage,
and the time spent on unit propagation. Because of this, learned clauses are
regularly deleted from the formula in an unsatisfiability-preserving way if
they are not considered useful.

2.2 Proofs of SAT Solvers' Unsatisfiability Results
---------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Redundancy Criteria} A clause $C$ is redundant in a
formula $F$ if $F$ and $F \cup \{C\}$ are satisfiability equivalent
\cite{DBLP:conf/cade/HeuleKB17}.  There are various criteria of redundancy,
with different levels of expressivity and computational costs.

- *RUP* --- a clause $C$ is a *reverse unit propagation* (RUP) inference
in formula $F$ if $F' := F \cup \{ \overline{l} \,|\, l \in C \}$ is
UP-unsatisfiable \cite{DBLP:conf/date/GoldbergN03}.  To compute whether $C$
is RUP, the negated literals in $C$ are added as assumptions and propagated
to determine whether the formula is UP-satisfiable. If after some propagation
steps the trail is a not a UP-model, $C$ is RUP. A clause that is RUP in $F$
is logical consequence of $F$ \cite{DBLP:conf/isaim/Gelder08}.

- *RAT* --- a clause $C$ is a *resolution asymmetric tautology* (RAT)
\cite{DBLP:conf/cade/JarvisaloHB12} on some literal $l \in C$ with respect
to formula $F$ whenever for all clauses $D \in F$ where $\overline{l} \in
D$, the *resolvent on $l$ of $C$ and $D$*, which is $(C \setminus \{l\})
\cup (D \setminus \{\overline{l}\})$, is RUP in $F$. Clause $D$ is called a
*resolution candidate* for $C$ and $l$ is called the *pivot*. Computing whether
a clause is RAT can be done with one RUP check for each resolution candidate.
A clause that is RAT in $F$ is not necessarily a logical consequence of $F$,
yet adding it to $F$ preserves satisfiability. RAT inference is non-monotonic:
if $C$ is RAT in $F$ then it may not be RAT in $F' \supseteq F$.

\paragraph{DRAT Proofs} Proofs based on RUP alone are not expressive
enough to simulate all inprocessing techniques in state-of-the-art
SAT solvers \cite{DBLP:conf/cade/HeuleHW13}. Because of this, the more
powerful criterion RAT is used today \cite{DBLP:journals/amai/Gelder12}
\cite{DBLP:conf/cade/HeuleHW13}.  A DRAT proof (*delete resolution asymmetric
tautology*) \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/WetzlerHH14} \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Heule16}
is a sequence of lemmas (clause introductions) and deletions, which can be
applied to a formula to simulate the clause introductions, clause deletions
and inprocessing steps that the solver performed. The *accumulated formula*
at each proof step is the result of applying all prior proof steps to the
input formula.  Based on the accumulated formula, the checker can compute
the shared UP-model at each step to determine UP-satisfiability. Every
lemma in a correct DRAT proof is a RUP or RAT inference with respect to
the accumulated formula.  In practice, most lemmas are RUP inferences, so
a checker first tries to check RUP, and if that fails, falls back to RAT.

In *specified DRAT*, checking is performed with respect to the accumulated
formula, while *operational DRAT* uses an *adjusted accumulated formula* that
is computed the same way as the accumulated formula except that deletions
of clauses that are unit with respect to the shared UP-model of the adjusted
accumulated formula are ignored \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}.

A proof solely consisting of clause introductions will result in the checker's
propagation routines slowing down due to the huge number of clauses just
like in a CDCL solver that does not delete learned clauses.  To counteract
this, clause deletion information has been added, making the proof-checking
time comparable to solving time \cite{DBLP:journals/stvr/HeuleHW14}
\cite{DBLP:conf/sat/WetzlerHH14}.  While deletions were added as an
optimization, they can also enable additional inferences due to RAT being
non-monotonic \cite{DBLP:conf/lpar/PhilippR17}.  This means that ignoring
deletions may prevent RAT inferences which is why a proof that is correct
under specified DRAT may be incorrect under operational DRAT.

\paragraph{LRAT Proofs} The runtime and memory usage of DRAT
checkers can exceed the ones of the solver that produced the proof
\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/Heule18}. The resulting need for a DRAT checker to
be as efficient as possible requires mutable data structures that rely on
pointer indirection which are difficult to formally verify.  The lack of a
formally verified DRAT checker is remedied by making the DRAT checker output an
annotated proof in the LRAT format \cite{DBLP:conf/cade/Cruz-FilipeHHKS17}. The
LRAT proof can be checked by a formally verified checker without unit
propagation, making sure that the formula formula is indeed unsatisfiable
\cite{DBLP:conf/itp/HeuleHKW17}.  Most solvers can only generate DRAT
proofs but DRAT checkers can be used to produce an LRAT proof from a DRAT
proof. The LRAT proof resembles DRAT, but it includes clause hints to guide
unit propagation: for each resolution candidate, the resolvent is shown to be
a RUP inference by giving a propagation sequence that shows UP-unsatisfiability
of the formula with the negated literals in the resolvent.

2.3 Proof Checking
------------------

We say that some tool *verifies* some property of an artifact when that
artifact has this property according to the semantics encoded in the tool.
This is not to be confused with formal verification; for state-of-the-art
DRAT checkers, there is no proof that the implementation corresponds to any
formal specification.

The naïve way to verify that a proof is correct consists of performing
each instruction in the proof from the first to the last one, while checking
each lemma.  To check an inference, the checker needs to compute the shared
UP-model of the accumulated formula. This is stored in the trail.  Instead of
recomputing the shared UP-model from scratch at each proof step, the trail
is modified incrementally: whenever a clause is added to the formula, the
propagation routine adds the missing literals to the trail. When a reason
clause is deleted, some literals may be removed.

\paragraph{Backwards Checking} During search, SAT solvers cannot know which
learned clauses are useful in a proof, so they add all of them as lemmas. This
means that many lemmas in a proof might not be necessary.  *Backwards checking*
\cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/HeuleHW13} avoids checking superfluous lemmas by
only checking *core* lemmas --- lemmas that are part of the *unsatisfiable
core*, an unsatisfiable subset of an unsatisfiable formula.  Initially, the
clauses from the propagation sequence that establishes UP-unsatisfiability
of the formula is added to the core.  Then the proof is processed backwards;
only core lemmas are checked.  Every lemma that is used in some propagation
sequence to derive another lemma is added to the core as well.  Clauses and
lemmas that are not in the core do not influence the unsatisfiability result
and are virtually dropped from the proof.  Tools like `DRAT-trim` can output
a *trimmed* proof that only contains core lemmas.

Backwards checking can be implemented using two passes over the proof:
a forward pass that merely performs unit propagation after applying each
proof step \cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/Rebola-PardoC18} until UP-unsatisfiability is
established, and a backward pass that checks lemmas as required.  The forward
pass enables the checker to record the state of the trail at each proof
step and efficiently restore it during the backward pass. If there are no
deletions of unique reason clauses, the shared UP-model grows monotonically,
and the trail can be restored by simply truncating it.

Here is an example for backwards checking: let $F = \{xyz, xy\overline{z},
\overline{x}y, x\overline{y}, \overline{x}\overline{y}, x\overline{z}\}$ be
an unsatisfiable formula with a proof consisting of two lemmas $(\textbf{add
} xy, \textbf{add } x)$. In the forward pass both lemmas are applied, then
the accumulated formula is UP-unsatisifiable.  To show UP-unsatisfiability,
assume we propagate clauses $x$, $\overline{x}y$ and $\overline{x}\overline{y}$
which are added to the core.  Then backwards checking can start: first we
check lemma $x$ because it is in the core: it is RUP in $F \cup \{xy\}$
since $F \cup \{xy\} \cup \{\overline{x}\}$ is UP-unsatisfiable.  We show
this by propagating the clauses $x\overline{y}$, $xyz$ and $xy\overline{z}$,
which are then added to the core. Subsequently we can skip checking lemma $xy$
because it is not in the core; it is virtually deleted from the proof.

\paragraph{Core-first Unit Propagation} To keep the core small and
reduce checking costs, core-first unit propagation was introduced
\cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/HeuleHW13}.  It works by doing unit propagation in
two alternating phases:

1. Propagate exhaustively using clauses already in the core.
2. If there is some non-core unit clause with an unassigned unit literal,
   add this literal to the trail and go to step 1, which will propagate this
   literal while only considering core clauses. Otherwise, terminate.

This results in a minimum of clauses being added to the core because whenever
UP-unsatisfiability can be shown without adding a new clause to the core,
this will be done by core-first unit propagation. This generally makes
checking faster because the number of visited clauses while propagating
decreases on average.

Consider the same example as above but assume we do check lemma $xy$, even
though it is not in the core. To show that $xy$ is RUP in $F$ we show that $F
\cup \{\overline{x}, \overline{y}\}$ is UP-unsatisfiable.  This can be done
by propagating clauses $xyz$ and $x\overline{z}$.  However, $x\overline{z}$ is
not in the core, so core-first propagation will use $xy\overline{z}$ instead.

\paragraph{Reason Deletions} Under operational DRAT, unit deletions are
ignored. Only proofs with unique reason deletions have different semantics
under specified and operational DRAT, because only those deletions alter the
shared UP-model. State-of-the-art DRAT checkers do not implement a way to
detect unique reason deletions, but they can emit a warning whenever a unit
clause is deleted.  To detect unique reason deletions, it is necessary check
whether a reason deletion alters the shared UP-model, which is only implemented
in specified DRAT checkers. A reason is a a clause that was used in some
propagation sequence to compute a literal $l$ in the trail. When a unique
reason clause is deleted, $l$ is no longer implied by unit propagation and
needs to be removed from the trail. This means that it is not possible anymore
to revert this modification of the trail in the backward pass by truncating the
trail. Instead, for each reason deletion, the removed literals are recorded
by the checker, along with their positions in the trail and their reasons.
This information can be used in the backward pass to restore the state of
the trail to be exactly the same as in the forward pass for each proof step,
which is what the algorithm from \cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/Rebola-PardoC18}
does along other non-trivial routines to maintain the watch invariants.

\paragraph{Reason Deletions in Inprocessing Steps} Some inprocessing
techniques introduce or delete variables \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}.
A deletion of a variable means that both of its literals are deleted from
all clauses.  A deletion of literal $l$ from a clause $C$ is modelled in
the proof by first adding $C \setminus \{l\}$ and subsequently deleting $C$.
Under operational DRAT, the deletion of $C$ is not performed if $C$ is a unit.
This may cause a misinterpretation of the proof if the variable $l$ is later
reused by being introduced by another inprocessing step.

Inprocessing steps for XOR reasoning \cite{DBLP:conf/jelia/PhilippR16}
and symmetry breaking \cite{DBLP:conf/cade/HeuleHW15} are
supported by proof fragments generated by hard-coded routines
\cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}.  It may not be easy or efficient
for such routines to produce proof fragments any without reason deletions.
Under operational DRAT the deleted reason clauses would linger, thus the
proof is checked in a different way than intended.

3 A Tiny Tweak to Proof Generation in `MiniSat`-based SAT Solvers
================================================================

Some state-of-the-art solvers produce proofs with deletions of unique
reason clauses.  A significant fraction of their proofs are incorrect under
specified DRAT.  Since these solvers act as if reason clauses were not deleted
we propose patches to avoid deletions of reason clauses, matching the solver's
internal behavior.  For the fragment of proofs without unique reason deletions,
operational and specified DRAT coincide because the accumulated formula and
the adjusted accumulated formula coincide, hence these proofs can be checked
with a checker of either flavor.

Out of the solvers submitted to the main track of the 2018 SAT competition,
the ones based on `MiniSat` and `CryptoMiniSat` produce proofs with deletions
of unique reasons while, to the best of our knowledge, others do not.

Let us explain how `DRUPMiniSat`[^drupminisat] emits unique reason deletions.
This solver performs simplification of the formula when there are no
assumptions (*decision-level zero*), so the trail is equivalent to the shared
UP-model of the formula without assumptions. The literals that are in the
trail at this point will never be unassigned by `DRUPMiniSat`.

One step in the simplification phase is the method `Solver::removeSatisfied`,
which for each clause $C$ that is satisfied by the shared UP-model, removes
$C$ from the clause database and emits a deletion of $C$ to the DRAT proof
output. Such a clause $C$ remains satisfied indefinitely for the rest of
the search because it is already satisfied by some literal that will never
be unassigned as stated above. For example, consider the formula $F = \{x,
xy\}$. The shared UP-model is $\{x\}$ and clause $x$ is the reason for
literal $x$.  Because both clauses are satisifed by the shared UP-model,
the solver would remove them and add deletions of $x$ and $xy$ to the proof.

In `MiniSat`, reason clauses are called *locked*.  The method
`Solver::removeSatisfied` also deletes locked clauses, however, the
literals propagated because of such a locked clause will not be unassigned.
This suggests that the locked clause is implicitly kept in the formula, even
though it is deleted.  State-of-the-art DRAT checkers ignore deletions of unit
clauses, which means that they do not unassign any literals when deleting
clauses, matching `DRUPMiniSat's` internal (but not external) behavior.
In above example, after deleting both clauses from $F$, the unique reason
clause for literal $x$ is gone. Therefore the shared UP-model does not
contain literal $x$ anymore.

We have proposed[^minisat-post] two possible changes to make `DRUPMiniSat`
produce proofs that do not require ignoring unit deletions when checking.

1. Do not remove locked clauses during simplification. In our example,
this would mean that $x$ is not deleted, so the shared UP-model stays the same.

2. Before removing a locked clause $C$, emit its unit literal $l \in C$ as
a introduction of size-one clause $l$ in the DRAT proof.  Suggested by Mate
Soos[^suggestion-add-units], this option is also preferred by the authors of
`mergesat`[^mergesat-pr] and `varisat`[^varisat-pr].  Additionally, this
is implemented in `CaDiCaL's` preprocessor.  This does not influence the
correctness of future inferences because $C$ and $l$ are logically equivalent
with respect to the shared UP-model --- they will behave identically for all
future inferences since the literals in assignment at decision-level zero will
never be unassigned.  In our example this means that another instance of $x$
is added in the proof, before one $x$ is deleted, which preserves the formula.

We provide patches implementing these for `MiniSat` version 2.2
(1.  [^patch-MiniSat-keep-locked-clauses] and 2.[^patch-MiniSat]),
and the winner of the main track of the 2018 SAT competition
(1.[^patch-MapleLCMDistChronoBT-keep-locked-clauses] and
2.[^patch-MapleLCMDistChronoBT]).  Both patches are arguably very simple
and we do not expect any significant impact in terms of solver runtime,
memory usage or proof size: the additional clauses will not be added to the
watchlists and do therefore not slow down propagation.  There can be at most
one locked clause per variable, so their memory usage is small.  The proof
will be larger only with the second variant by adding at most one unit clause
addition per variable, which is tiny compared to the rest of a typical proof.
The patches can be easily adapted to other `DRUPMiniSat`-based solvers.

4 A Complete and Efficient DRAT Proof Checker
=============================================

We have implemented a checker to compare the costs of checking specified and
operation DRAT. Additionally an efficient checker for specified DRAT can be
useful to verify solvers' inprocessing steps that contain unit deletions.
In this section, we discuss our checker implementation after introducing
existing checkers.  Finally we describe the format for SICK witnesses,
which can be produced by our checker to verify proof incorrectness.

4.1 Existing Checkers
---------------------

We heavily draw upon existing checkers. In fact, our implementation contains
no algorithmic novelties but merely combines the ideas present in existing
checkers.

\paragraph{\texttt{DRAT-trim}} The seminal reference implementation; Marijn
Heule's `DRAT-trim` can produce a trimmed proof in the DRAT or LRAT format. We
mimic[^sortSize] their way of producing LRAT proofs and ensure that all our
proofs are verified by a formally verified checker.  This gives us confidence
in the correctness of our implementation and allows for a comparison of our
checker with `DRAT-trim` since both have the same input and output formats.

[^sortSize]: See the function `sortSize()` in `DRAT-trim`.

`DRAT-trim` pioneered deletions, backwards checking and core-first propagation.
Additionally it employs an optimization which we also use: during RAT checks,
resolution candidates that are not in the core are ignored, because the
proof can be rewritten to delete them immediately before the current lemma.
Here is why this is sound: let $l$ be the pivot literal and $D$ a non-core
clause that is a resolution candidate, so $\overline{l} \in D$.  During the
backwards pass, a RAT check is performed using $l$ as pivot.  Since $D$
is not in the core, it was never used in a **later** inference since we
are checking lemmas from last to first.  By ignoring $D$ as RAT candidate
it is virtually removed from the proof.  This is sound, that is, a correct
RAT inference on pivot $l$ does not depend on the clause $D$, so it can be
freely removed. This is the case because in the RAT check, the resolution
candidate becomes unit after propagating the reverse literals in resolvent,
so unit literal $\overline{l}$ is satisfied, or rather $l$ is falsified. This
makes $D$ a tautology which will never be used to derive a conflict and thus
make an inference[^gratgen-noncore-rat-candidates].

\paragraph{GRAT Toolchain} More recently, Peter Lammich has published the
GRAT toolchain \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Lammich17}.  Given a DRAT proof, they first
produce a GRAT proof which is similar to LRAT with the `gratgen` tool, which
outperforms `DRAT-trim` \cite{DBLP:conf/cade/Lammich17}.  Subsequently, the
formally verified `gratchk` can be used to check the GRAT proof, guaranteeing
that the original formula is indeed unsatisfiable.  We also implement GRAT
generation in our tool. However, the `gratchk` tool ignores unit deletions,
so GRAT proofs are only useful for operational DRAT as of now.

Here are two of their optimizations:

- Separate watchlists for core and non-core clauses[^gratgen-cf]. This
  speeds up core-first unit propagation, so we use it in our implementation.
  The clauses in the core are kept in different watchlists than non-core
  clauses. Since most time is spent in propagation, this can give a significant
  speed-up to core-first propagation. Without separate watchlists, core-first
  propagation traverses the same watchlists twice, first in core-mode and
  then in non-core-mode.  For each visited clause they check if it is in the
  core and propagate if that matches the current mode. This boils down to to
  a branch instruction which can be moved outside the loop by partitioning
  the watchlists into core and non-core clauses.

- Resolution candidate caching / RAT run heuristic
\cite{DBLP:conf/cade/Lammich17}:
  DRAT proofs tend to contain sequences of RAT lemmas with the same pivot, in
  which case they only compute the list of RAT candidates once per sequence
  and reuse it for all lemmas with the same pivot. We did not implement
  that since we do not have benchmarks with a significant number of RAT
  introductions compared to the number of RUP introductions.

Among state-of-the-art DRAT checkers, `gratgen` is arguably the easiest to
understand --- even though it can do a parallel checking --- so we advise
interested readers to study that.

\paragraph{\texttt{rupee}} This is the original implementation[^rupee] of
the first efficient algorithm to honor unique reason deletions. We use the
same algorithm.  During our research we found one issue in the implementation
which was fixed[^fix-revise-watches].

In previous experiments, `rupee` was an order of magnitude slower than
`DRAT-trim` \cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/Rebola-PardoC18}.  We believe that this
overhead is primarily not a consequence of algorithmic differences but of
implementation details such as missing optimizations in the parser and the
lack of function inlining.  Additionally, `rupee` does not use core-first
unit propagation while the other checkers do.

4.2 Checker Implementation
--------------------------

Our checker is called `rate` which may stand for "`rate`
ain't trustworthy either". It is a MIT-licensed clausal proof
checker that aims to be user-friendly, easy-to-understand
and efficient. Source code and documentation can be found at
[`https://github.com/krobelus/rate/`](https://github.com/krobelus/rate/).

To facilitate adoption, `rate` is a drop-in replacement for a subset of
`DRAT-trim`'s functionality --- the unsatisfiability check with core extraction
--- with the important difference that it checks specified DRAT by default.
When a proof is verified, `rate` can output core lemmas as DIMACS, LRAT
or GRAT.  Otherwise, the rejection of a proof can be supported by a SICK
certificate of incorrectness.  The representation of the input DRAT proof ---
binary or textual -- is automatically detected the same way as `DRAT-trim`.
Additionally, compressed input files (Gzip, Zstandard, Bzip2, XZ, LZ4)
are transparently uncompressed.

We provide two options that alter the semantics of the checker:

1. Unit deletions can be skipped with the flag `-d`.
   This makes `rate` check operational DRAT instead of specified DRAT.
   
2. If the flag `--assume-pivot-is-first` is given, the pivot must be the first
   literal in a RAT lemma, otherwise the proof will be rejected.

Among other metrics, `rate` can output the number of reason deletions and
unique reason deletions[^reason-deletions-shrinking-trail]. Other checkers
cannot provide the latter. This might be useful to validate that a proof
contains no unique reason deletion, since most solvers do not use advanced
inprocessing techniques requiring unique reason deletions and thus probably
do not need to use them.

As other state-of-the-art checkers, `rate` deviates from the specification of
DRAT \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Heule16} where that is convenient or necessary
for competitive performance. For example, it fails when given $2^{30}$
or more clauses. Like other checkers, `rate` accepts proofs that do not
contain the empty clause. Due to backwards checking many lemmas are skipped,
so proofs with incorrect lemmas may be accepted as well.  We allow proofs
that are missing a zero-terminator in their last proof step because some
solvers in the 2018 SAT competition did not always write that zero.

The checker is extensible to other clausal proof formats, for example
we support the proof format, DPR (*delete propagation redundancy*)
\cite{DBLP:conf/cade/HeuleKB17} which supersedes DRAT.

To automatically minimize inputs that expose bugs in our checker we have
developed a set of scripts to delta-debug CNF and DRAT instances.  Consider
that we had proof instances of several gigabytes that provoked crashes in
`rate`.  Using a combination of binary search and deletion of random lines
we were usually able to minimize interesting instances to mere kilobytes.
One important tool do do binary search in proofs is our `apply-proof`, which
takes a formula and a clausal proof and applies a given number of proof steps,
outputting the accumulated formula as well as the rest of the proof.

We chose the modern systems programming language Rust[^rust] for our
implementation because of its feature parity with C in the domain of
SAT solving.  Among the respondents of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer
Survey[^so-survey] it is the most loved programming language and Rust
developers have the highest contribution rate to open source projects.
Based on our experience, we believe that it is a viable alternative to C
or C++ for SAT solving, assuming people are willing to learn the language.
The first Rust-based solver to take part in competitions, `varisat`[^varisat],
is a great example of this. They use a library[^partial-ref] to avoid writing
a lot of boilerplate code necessary to satisfy Rust's borrow checker.

Rust aims to avoid any undefined behavior.  For example, buffer overflows are
prevented by performing runtime bounds checks upon array access.  While for
most programs those bounds checks have negligible impact on performance
(branch prediction can handle them seamlessly), we disable bounds checking by
default in most routines, which gave speedups of around 15% in preliminary
tests.  Furthermore, our checker implementation contains a variety of cheap
runtime assertions, including checks for arithmetic overflows and narrowing
conversions that cause a change of value.

4.3 The SICK Format
-------------------

For DRAT proofs that are verified by `rate`, it can produce an LRAT proof
containing core lemmas. The formally verified LRAT checker can be used
to certify that the LRAT proof is a correct proof of unsatisfiability,
which suggests that the original DRAT proof is correct as well.  However,
many proofs are rejected by our checker for specified DRAT.  To trust those
results, we want to independently verify the incorrectness of such proofs.

A DRAT proof is incorrect if any of its lemmas is not a RUP or RAT inference.
To show that a lemma $C$ is not RUP in the accumulated formula $F$, it suffices
to show that $F \cup \{ \overline{l} \,|\, l \in C \}$ is UP-satisfiable.
On top of that, to show that $C$ is not RAT, it suffices to show that any
resolvent with $C$ is not RUP.  For example, consider formula $F = \{xy,
\overline{x}y, x\overline{y}\}$ and lemma $\overline{x}\overline{y}$ which
is neither RUP nor RAT. To refute RUP for lemma $\overline{x}\overline{y}$
we find a UP-model of $F \cup \{xy\}$, for example $\emptyset$ or $\{xy\}$.
To refute RAT for $\overline{x}\overline{y}$ on pivot $\overline{x}$ we
check that some resolvent on $\overline{x}$ is not RUP.  The first resolvent
$y\overline{y}$ is a tautology and thus trivially RUP but the second resolvent
$\overline{y}$ is not: $F \cup \{y\}$ has a UP-model $\{xy\}$. The same
thing can be shown for the resolvents on the other pivot $\overline{y}$.

Since our checker already computes the shared UP-model for each RUP check,
we can output that for an incorrect inference and check the inference with
an independent tool.  This tool can be much simpler than the checker because
it does not need to implement unit propagation. This is useful because unit
propagation with watchlists is non-trivial to implement correctly for specified
DRAT.  A bug in a watchlist implementation typically provokes problems when
it causes some clause to not be watched when it is unit which means that the
propagation may be incomplete.  If so, the shared UP-model computed by the
checker is smaller than the actual shared UP-model. This can be detected easily
by looking for a clause that is unit but not satisifed.  On the other hand,
if the checker's shared UP-model is bigger than the actual shared UP-model,
that would be a bug that is not easily be detected by such a tool.  However,
a proof is never incorrectly rejected because the computed shared UP-model is
too large, since a larger model increases the likelihood of finding a conflict.

Proof incorrectness certificates have been proposed in
\cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}.  The format we use is called *SICK*. It
was originally developed for `rupee`.  A certificate in our SICK format can
be used by our tool `sick-check` to verify incorrectness of the proof without
doing any unit propagation. Furthermore, the incorrectness certificate is
tiny compared to the formula. We have fixed some bugs in our checker that
were exposed by `sick-check`.  The SICK file format is using TOML[^toml]
syntax; see Figure \ref{grammar} for a grammar.  An example application of
a SICK certificate is shown in Figure \ref{sick-example}.  The first two
columns show a satisfiable formula with two binary clauses in DIMACS format
and an incorrect DRAT proof for this formula. The proof consists of two
lemmas, a size-one clause, and the empty clause.  The third column shows the
corresponding SICK certificate, stating that the RUP and RAT checks failed
for the first lemma in the proof.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{Explanation}

- `proof_step` specifies the proof step that failed (by offset in the proof,
  starting at one for the first proof step).  For the remainder of this
  section, let the *lemma* denote the clause that is introduced by the
  referenced proof step.  For a textual proof that has each proof step on
  a separate line, this corresponds to the line number of the introduction
  instruction that failed.
  If `proof_step` is omitted, it means that the proof does not add enough
  clauses to make the accumulated formula UP-unsatisifiable.
- `proof_format` describes the proof format to use.
   We added the distinction between these two formats because it was not
   clear which one should be used exclusively.
   - `DRAT-arbitrary-pivot`: DRAT checking where the pivot can be any literal
   in the lemma. This requires one witness (counter-example) for each possible
   pivot in the lemma. The pivot has to be specified for each witness.
   - `DRAT-pivot-is-first-literal`: Similar, but there is only one witness.
   The pivot needs to be the first literal in the lemma.

   Not all current solvers put the pivot as first literal of a RAT lemma,
   therefore in practise `DRAT-arbitrary-pivot` is usually desired. New
   proof formats such as PR however require specifying the witness explicitly.

- `natural_model` gives the shared UP-model before checking this proof step.
   If `proof_step` is omitted, this is the shared UP-model after applying
   all proof steps.

Each witness is a counter-example to some inference and comprises the
following elements:

- `failing-clause`: A clause in the formula, which is a resolution candidate
  for the lemma.  This means that the RUP check failed for the resolvent on
  the pivot literal of the lemma and the failing clause.
- `failing-model`: The literals that were added to the natural model (trail)
  when performing the failed inference check.
- `pivot`: This specifies the pivot literal.

If the lemma is the empty clause, no witness is necessary, since the empty
clause cannot be RAT. Additionally, if the `proof_step` is omitted, no
witness is necessary either.

\paragraph{Semantics} Our tool `sick-check` verifies SICK certificates that
fulfill below properties.

Let $F$ be the accumulated formula up to and excluding the lemma.

1. The proof contains the `proof_step` (if present).
2. The given `natural_model` is a UP-model of $F$.
3. For each witness, consisting of `failing_clause`, `failing_model` and `pivot`.
    1. The `failing_clause` is in $F$.
    3. The union of `natural_model` and `failing_model` is a UP-model of
       $F \cup \{ \overline{l} \,|\, l \in r\}$
       where $r$ is the resolvent on `pivot` of the lemma and the `failing_clause`.
4. If the format is `DRAT-arbitrary-pivot`, the lemma is equal to the set
of the pivots in the given witnesses.

A SICK certificate can only be produced by checker of specified DRAT, because
to compute the accumulated formula in an operational checker, one would
need to do unit propagation which is avoided by design in the SICK checker.
This is a potential benefit of a specified checker: the accumulated formula
at each proof step can be computed without unit propagation.

\paragraph{Contribution} Our contribution to the SICK format consists of the
design of the new syntax that takes into account the variants of DRAT with
a fixed or an arbitrary pivot.


5 Experimental Evaluation
=========================

Here we present a performance evaluation of our checker.  Technical details
are available[^rate-experiments].  We analyze four checkers:

1. `rate`
2. `rate-d` \hfill (the flag `-d` means *"skip unit deletions"*)
3. `DRAT-trim`
4. `gratgen`

Only `rate` checks specified DRAT, the other three implement operational DRAT.

\paragraph{Experimental Setting} Each individual benchmark consists of a
SAT problem instance and a solver to produce a proof for this instance.
For each benchmark, we run the solvers with the same limits as in the SAT
competition --- a maximum of 5000 seconds CPU time and 24 GB memory, both
imposed by runlim[^runlim]. Then we run the checkers on the resulting proof
using a time limit of 20000 seconds, as in the competition.  For `rate`,
`rate-d` and `DRAT-trim`, we did ensure that the LRAT proof is verified by
the verfied checker `lrat-4`[^lrat-check] in preliminary runs.  However,
we do not generate LRAT (or GRAT) proofs for the final measurements because
based on preliminary experiments we do not expect any interesting differences
stemming from LRAT proof output routines.  For proofs rejected by `rate`,
we run `sick-check`, to double-check that the proof is incorrect under to
the semantics of specified DRAT.  For the final evaluation we also disabled
assertions and logging in `rate` and `rate-d` which seems to give small
speedups.

We performed all experiments on a machine with two AMD Opteron 6272 CPUs
with 16 cores each and 220 GB main memory running Linux version 4.9.189.
We used GNU parallel \cite{Tange2018} to run 32 jobs simultaneously. Such a
high load slows down the solvers and checkers, likely due to increased memory
pressure. Based on preliminary experiments we expect that the checkers are
affected equally so we assume that a comparison between the checkers is fair.

\paragraph{Benchmark Selection} We take from the 2018 SAT competition[^sc18]
both the SAT instances and the solvers from the main track, excluding
benchmarks that are not interesting for our purpose of evaluating `rate's`
performance.  We consider only unsatisfiable instances where the solver does
not time out, and where the resulting proof is not rejected by `rate`. The
latter condition ensures a fair comparison in terms of checker performance:
when `rate` rejects a proof it terminates as soon as an incorrect instruction
is encountered in the backward pass. This means that it has verified only a
fraction of the proof while other checkers would verify the entire proof. Hence
it is not useful for benchmarking checker performance to include proofs that
are rejected under specified DRAT.

Starting from the benchmarks where --- according to the competition
results[^sc18-results] --- the solver successfully produced a proof of
unsatisfiability, here is how many benchmarks were removed by the criteria
mentioned above:

\begin{tabular}{p{.07\textwidth}p{.07\textwidth}p{.07\textwidth}lr}
\toprule
\multicolumn{4}{l}{All benchmarks}                                            & 3653 \\
&\multicolumn{3}{l}{where the solver does not time out}                       & 3605 \\

&&\multicolumn{2}{l}{from which \texttt{rate} rejects the proof due to an overflow} & 1    \\
&&\multicolumn{2}{l}{selected benchmarks}                                     & 842  \\
\midrule
&&&\multicolumn{1}{l}{from which \texttt{rate} verifies the proof}                       & 839  \\
&&&\multicolumn{1}{l}{from which \texttt{rate} times out}                                & 2    \\
&&&\multicolumn{1}{l}{from which \texttt{rate} runs out of memory}                       & 1    \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

5.1 Comparison of Checkers
--------------------------

We present performance data as reported by `runlim` --- time in seconds and
memory usage in megabytes (2^20^ bytes).

On an individual instance, two checkers can exhibit different performance
because of different propagation orders and, as a result, different
clauses being added to the core. Instead we compare the distribution of the
checkers' performance.  The distribution has a long tail of instances where
the checkers' performance is similar. In Figure \ref{fig:cactus} we show only
the head of that distribution where some differences emerge.  We conclude that
`gratgen` is a bit faster, and `DRAT-trim` is slower than `rate`. As expected,
`rate`, and `rate -d` show roughly the same distribution of runtimes. Because
`DRAT-trim` and `rate` use almost the same data structures they use roughly
the same amount of memory, while `gratgen` needs a bit more.

For a more detailled view, we compare each checker to `rate-d` on individual
instances in Figure \ref{fig:cross}: we see that `rate` and `rate-d` behave
alike on most instances; `gratgen` is faster than `rate-d` on most instances,
and `rate-d` is faster than `DRAT-trim` on most instances.

5.2 Overhead of Reason Deletions
--------------------------------

Handling reason deletions may require extra time and memory. Figure
@fig:correlation-reason-deletions shows the number of reason deletions and
the overhead of `rate` compared to `rate-d` --- among our benchmarks runtime
at most doubles. Currently, `rate` incurs these extra costs also for proofs
that contain no unique reason deletions (where unit deletions could simply
be ignored altogether) --- these instances are shown with red markers.

memory overhead of checking specified DRAT over operational
DRAT.](p/correlation-reason-deletions.pdf){#fig:correlation-reason-deletions}

6 Conclusion
============

State-of-the-art SAT solvers produce proofs with deletions of unique
reason clauses. These proofs are often incorrect under specified DRAT. Under
operational DRAT they are correct because those deletions will effectively be
removed from the proof. In [Section 3][3 A Tiny Tweak to Proof Generation
in `MiniSat`-based SAT Solvers] we have explained how `DRUPMiniSat`-based
solvers produce proofs with unique reason deletions that render them incorrect
under specified DRAT, and we have proposed patches to avoid those deletions,
removing the need to ignore deletions to verify their proofs.

As we explained at the end of [Section 2][2 Preliminaries], specified DRAT is
necessary to verify solvers' inprocessing steps that employ deletions of unique
reason clauses \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/Rebola-PardoB18}. Our research question
was whether specified DRAT can be checked as efficiently as operational
DRAT. Previous work has yielded an efficient algorithm but no competitive
checker. We have implemented the first checker delivering state-of-the-art
performance while supporting both specified and operational DRAT. We provide
experimental results suggesting that that the cost for specified DRAT is,
on average, the same but a high number of reason deletions may make it
significantly more costly.

The two-watched literal scheme is difficult to implement correctly, and the
optimizations from \cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/Rebola-PardoC18} to check specified
DRAT efficiently further complicate that.  Our checker implementation
is able to output LRAT and GRAT certificates that can be verified by a
formally verified checker, giving some confidence that `rate` gave the right
answer. However, many proofs are rejected by `rate`. We needed a way to
trust those incorrectness results.  We extended the previously unpublished
SICK format for proof incorrectness certificates and implemented a tool,
`sick-check` that verifies those certificates, independent of `rate`.
Since `sick-check` merely computes the accumulated formula up to the failed
proof step and then checks that step without doing any propagation it is
much simpler than a DRAT checker. These certificates can be used to detect
bugs in checkers (we did find some in `rate`) and pinpoint bugs in solvers.

7 Future Work
=============

If specified DRAT were to be adopted, it might be beneficial to implement a
way to perform deletions of non-unique reasons more efficiently than `rate`
does. These deletions do not alter the shared UP-model but `rate` assumes they
do and does more work than necessary, which sometimes even doubles the runtime
for our benchmarks, as we showed in Figure @fig:correlation-reason-deletions.
An optimization could consist of an efficiently computable criterion to
determine if some reason clause is unique.  A simple criterion is as follows:
if a reason clause for some literal $l$ is deleted, check if unit clause $l$
is in the formula. If it is, then the deleted reason is not unique and the
shared UP-model will definitely not change.  This criterion might be sufficient
for the proofs produced by the second variant of the patches from [section
3][3 A Tiny Tweak to Proof Generation in `MiniSat`-based SAT Solvers].

State-of-the-art DRAT checkers are heavily optimized for speed but they
keep the entire input proof and the resulting LRAT proof in memory. If the
available memory is at premium, some changes could be made to do backwards
checking in an online fashion, processing one proof step at a time.  Similarly,
an LRAT proof line could be written to disk immediately after checking the
corresponding lemma, with some postprocessing to fix the clause IDs.

It might be possible to forego DRAT completely and directly generate LRAT
in a solver which is already supported by `varisat`. This removes the need
for a complex checker at the cost of a larger proof artifact.
