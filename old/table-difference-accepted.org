This [[file:t/difference-accepted.csv][table]] shows the execution time of rate with and without reason deletions. Instances rejected by ~rate~ are left out since it doesn't make sense to compare performance for those. The table is sorted descendingly by the difference of ~rate time~ minus ~rate --skip-unit-deletions time~.
